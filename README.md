# Bank-System-Project
a console-based bank management system built in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP). It simulates common banking operations such as managing client accounts, performing transactions, handling currency exchanges, and tracking user activities. The system is structured with multiple classes that represent different entities like clients, users, currencies, transactions, and screens for user interaction.

### Key features include:
- **Client management:** Adding, updating, deleting, and viewing clients.
- **User management:** Login, registration, and administrative tasks for managing users.
- **Transactions:** Deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between client accounts.
- **Currency Exchange:** Converting currencies based on exchange rates.
- **Logging:** Transaction logs and user login records for tracking actions.
